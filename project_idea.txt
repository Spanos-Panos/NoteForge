ok so let me describe you the project i want more so will know how we moving next.
 so its gonna be a desktop application, when we open it we can see login / sign up
 or if we have a accout we will skip this page , after we gonna have the main
 menu , this gonna have those , out avatar/profile on the top corner , a setting
 icon on the other top corner , in the settting we can change the theme
 dark/light mode , sizes , aux things . in the middle i want 2 buttons . like
 "Projects" and under it "Notes" on top of projects its gonna be the tittle. so on
 the projects i want it to work like that .we can create a new project or keep
 track/edit/delete etc a already existing one if we have one . so when we click
 create project i want it so we can add . a picture for it.we gonna have a
 preset of pictures, we can set a name for our project , a description , and
 some notes , on the technical stuff we can change those.(we gonna have presets
 for all the options).so we have some categories.
frontend : we can choose languages , frameworks/libraries/styles/components
 folders or websites etc , i want to cover almost everything
backend: again a framework , libraries , languages i want to cover almost everything
apis
auth
deploy
dev tools
Etc etc
i want everycategory to COVER EVERYTHING , as much as we can . 
so for each category i want something like a mix like we set the options will
 clickble arrows like dropdown border with options , or some user input notes and
 stuff
so when the user set the picture , desciption , SCOPE(almost the most important
 one) and the full stuck , he can click save and the program its gonna load and
 right after (we gonna make a sick loading screen)we can see preview his project
 organized. its gonna be like a open book
Left page we can see his project / descriptions full stuck etc , and to the
 right we can write down things and stuff like that . so we covered this thing .
 i want something more advanced now . so now lets go back to notes button , i
 want when the user press it to open again a book for notes , i want to cover
 almost everything because that where people + me are weak , i want to have mini
 paragraphs + how to + suggestions + requirements + even small pictures. so i
 want it so we can cover everything . we gonna have as much as full
 stucks(and not) as we can  .so we gonna have something like presets .lets take
 for example this full stuck "Frontend	TypeScript + React + TailwindCSS	You’ll
 build all UI/UX here — notebook theme, animations, etc. TypeScript gives type
 safety, Tailwind makes styling easy and consistent.
Backend	Next.js (with TypeScript)	Great choice — Next.js includes its own backend routes (/api) so you don’t even need a separate server at first. Perfect for fullstack in one project.
Database	PostgreSQL	Strong relational DB, perfect for structured data like your projects, timers, notes, etc.
ORM / Database Layer	Prisma	Connects your Next.js backend to PostgreSQL with auto-generated TypeScript types. Clean, safe, and modern.
Auth	Supabase	Handles signup, login, sessions, and profiles. Works beautifully with Next.js and Prisma.
API Style	REST API	Easy to start with. You can later evolve it into GraphQL if you want.
Dev Tools	VS Code, GitHub, Postman	The essential trio for coding, version control, and API testing.
Hosting	Vercel	Seamless for Next.js apps. You can deploy both your frontend and
 backend in one click." so we gonna have something like how to create the
 project stracture  , what and how to run on the cmd to run the project , how to
 set it up.. on the notes things i dont want to only cover this full stuck , i
 want it to include like project stracture , nite .Net , like simple html css js
 websites , compponents . each of those can have more or less info. but i want
 none of the above to be spesific,, so on the notes page we gonna have this ,
 and somewhere i think its better either let the user write his own
 sections(lets call all of the above sections , like .net section . typescript
 section etc etc) or let the user have a free form writing page somewhere. so
 now lets talk about some features i want to include 
1st we can have some relaxing music plying with something like a disk image name
 and artist on some corner , we can make it interactive with stop/play , next
 prev ,and some other stuff
2nd we can add a progress system on the projects tab , so we can set timers to
 learn something , add like deadlines and some stuff like that(i thinks this have
 to be a main thing and not a feature)
3rd we can have something like rewarding system , like if the user complete or
 study for the timer he has set or do something like a mission he can get some
 coins to buy maybe some cosmetics , or if he dont complete he losses sum
4.i want each section to have like different color or theme , 
So overall we gonna have a full stuck project with projects and user and other
 stuff connected to a database . i want the whole app to have a sketch , hand
 drawing theme , like a notbook but with a unique style , like a "chalk" style.
 how does this sound?
